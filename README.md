# Consensus

This project has two orthogonal purposes:

1. I want to learn how to use coding agents. I am using open AI's codex for this. This is the first time I am letting an AI agent touch any code at all. I want to see how good they are. I might very well discard the AI code in the end if I dislike it. I expect to finish this in 3-4 months time. This is a weekend project to help me learn. 

2. I want to formalise the asynchronous computability theorem. This theorem is a characterisation of a famous consensus impossibility result which describes impossibility of consensus in the presence of faults through a framework using simplical complexes. I also intend to learn/re-learn the relevant theory along the way. So I will use an incremental approach to building this. 

3. This is an edit I make after 3 hours. I want to first formalise the FLP result.
